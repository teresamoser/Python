# Overview
I am trying to increase my knowledge of computer languages. I am studying Python 3.9 to use as a future programmer. I have tried using Python on a previous team working on a game. I enjoyed what I was able to accomplish with the little amount of knowledge that I had in Python. I have delved into a Python tutorial by W3 Schools and was able to understand more about the nuances of this language. I hope to be able to use it more in the future of my programming career.

# Description
This program is written in Python 3.9. I used Visual Studio Code on my Mac computer and downloaded the Python 3.9 language to use in Visual Studio. I also linked GitHub to my Visual Studio so that I can push my file and publish it in GitHub. 

This program is a guessing a number game that the computer has randomly chosen between the numbers that the user provides. There is an algorithm used to help determine how many chances you get to guess the number. This algorithm is based on narrowing down the range of numbers by guessing half the number of the high end and then depending on high or low guessing half again and again until it is narrowed down to the random number that was picked.

The user sets the boundaries for the range of the random number generated. I was also able to put the game in a restart mode by asking if the user would like to play again. If "yes" the program restarts. If "no" then the game exits. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate what I was able to learn as I studied the Python language, and to build a program that is fun to play and it also challenges our ablility to guess what number the computer randomly chose.  I also, wanted to know if I could create a program game and improve upon it. I was able to make adjustments and worked out the kinks until it ran successfully. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

    * Item 1 - I would like to fix the program to include invalid entries by the user. I wnat the program to let the user know that they must enter the correct type of answer.
    * Item 2 - I would like to be able to open a new window so it is not just showing on the terminal below the program. I would like to have a clean slate each time the game is restarted.
    * Item 3 - I would like to add color to the screen, or maybe a background color to be more appealing to the eye. Even add motion characters for each win, keep a tally for wins and losses, do a "Hurray" screen when you win, or a sad sound for losing.
